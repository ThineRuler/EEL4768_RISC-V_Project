# Phase 5 documentation

You can find the documentation and problem descriptions for phase five in `phase_5/documentation/phase_5.pdf`. Be sure to **read all pages** of the PDF. There is one part to this phase. You also submit all previous files (that is, `hart.v`, `decoder.v`, `imm.v`, `alu.v`, `rf.v`).

1. Instruction and data cache (`cache.v`), instantiated twice inside your pipelined `hart.v`

The skeletons in `phase_5/skeletons/` show the new `hart.v` ports and parameters, and the `cache.v` module header.

# Install

I recommend using conda, as this will allow you to install everything needed.

https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

Once you have conda, follow the instructions below.

### Linux/MacOS

```
git clone https://github.com/UnaryLab/EEL4768_RISC-V_Project
cd EEL4768_RISC-V_Project/phase_5/
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
Then, you can activate the conda environment
```
conda activate eel4768_phase_5
```
You need to reactivate or make sure you are in this conda env before running your testbench every time.

### Windows

Icarus and GTK cannot be directly installed through conda. If you have a windows system, I recommend either using [wsl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows subsystem for linux), or you can use the [eustis server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGm5RdI_gNA).

Both of these solutions will run a linux operating system. If you have issues, please come to my office hours.

# Testing your work

**There is no autograder in this repository.** Verifying that your `hart.v`,
`cache.v`, `alu.v`, `imm.v`, `rf.v` and `decoder.v` behave correctly is part of the assignment.
Your testbench also needs a main memory for your caches to talk to.
Follow the example testbench outlined in `phase_2/example/` to understand how to write a testbench.

## Compilation test

`scripts/check_design.sh` is a script that lets you test your design to see if it can compile without errors.
**It does not tell you if your processor functions or not.**
It exists to tell you if your code can compile and run within Iverilog and the testing harness that is used to grade your design.
It also reports two coding rule violations that the autograder rejects before it runs any test: a banned preprocessor directive (`` `include ``, `` `ifndef ``, `` `elsif ``, or any `` `ifdef `` other than `` `ifdef RISCV_FORMAL ``), and a system task such as `$display`.
If you pass this, all you know is that you will not lose points because of compile errors or those two rules. You can still lose points for breaking the other coding rules, or for your processor not functioning.

You can run this in a Linux or macOS environment:

```
bash scripts/check_design.sh <name> <submission_dir>
```

Name is your name, or you can label it "test".
Submission dir is the location of your code. Only the `.v` files directly inside it are compiled, the same files the grader compiles.

If everything passes, the script prints `Your design compiled successfully.` Otherwise, it prints every problem it found.

## The example

`phase_2/example/` holds two files:

- **`opmux.v`** -- a small combinational module: four inputs (`i_a`, `i_b`,
  `i_sel`, `i_en`), two outputs (`o_result`, `o_zero`), and a two-bit select
  choosing between `+`, `-`, `<<` and `>>`.
- **`opmux_tb.v`** -- a self-checking testbench for it. **This is the file to
  read.** It is commented as a walkthrough, and its structure is the one every
  testbench you write this semester will have.

## The traces

`phase_5/traces/` holds one program for your hart to run and the data memory it must leave behind:

- **`random_program.hex`**: The initial instruction memory, loaded at `0x00400000`.
- **`random_dmem.hex`**: The expected final data memory, starting at `0x10010000`.

There is no expected trace this time. Your testbench runs the program until the final `ebreak` retires, and then compares every word of its data memory with `random_dmem.hex`.
`phase_5/traces/README.md` describes the main memory your testbench must model, the cache configuration these files use, and how to read a failure.

## Run iverilog

To run the example testbench, follow the script below. To run your own verilog file and testbench, just replace the paths for the testbench and target file.

```
cd EEL4768_RISC-V_Project/phase_2/
iverilog -s opmux_tb -o sim example/opmux_tb.v example/opmux.v
./sim
```

For phase 5, list your testbench and every file your hart needs:

```
iverilog -g2005 -s hart_tb -o sim hart_tb.v hart.v cache.v alu.v imm.v rf.v decoder.v
./sim
```

`-s` names the top module to elaborate, `-o` names the simulator to write, and
every source file the design needs is listed after them. `-g2005` compiles
the files as Verilog-2005, the same way grading does.

Running the example prints:

```
========== opmux testbench ==========
--- add ---
[PASS] add: 7 + 9
[PASS] add: 0 + 0 sets zero
...
212 passed, 0 failed
ALL TESTS PASSED
```

## Waveforms

The example also writes `opmux.vcd`:

```
gtkwave opmux.vcd
```

Add `$dumpfile`/`$dumpvars` to your own testbench the same way to get a waveform of your hart.

This outputs a waveform, similar to the ones from digital systems, to view. This is helpful for debugging.
